<!--## Replication of experimental results-->

## Usage

The required data can be generated using **data_generate_BrownianMotion.py**, and a custom configuration **settings.yaml** file can be used for DNN or MCFormer models to call data and store models.

If you want to reproduce the experiments in the paper, you can run **Exp_BER_test.py** and **Exp_SNR_test.py** directly.

## More details about data generation algorithm

It uses matrix operation to substantially expedite the data generation process.
The more details can be seen below:

**step 1** : Calculate the effect step $K_e$ï¼Œe.g. $K_e=3$.

**step 2** : Iterate through the transmitted signal sequence, e.g. S=[1,1,1,0,0].
![step2](./pics/readme_pics/step2.png)

**step 3** : For each transmitted signal si=1, create a matrix $N_{tmp}(M,K_eT)$ to save which moments particles are observed, e.g. M=4, T=5$\Delta t$.
![step3](./pics/readme_pics/step3.png)

**step 4** : Produces net displacement matrix of M particles in each moment. The net displacement in the x-axis direction obeys $\mathcal{N}\left(v\Delta t,\sqrt{2\mathrm{D}\Delta t}\right)$, and the y- and z-axis directions obey $\mathcal{N}\left(0,\sqrt{2\mathrm{D}\Delta t}\right)$, e.g. $v=30\mu m/s,\Delta t=0.04 s, T=0.2 s$.

**step 5** : Accumulate and obtain the coordinate matrix of the particles at each moment.

![step5](./pics/readme_pics/step5.png)

**step 6** : Calculate the distance between particle and the receiver center point (with the broadcast mechanism in Python.

![step6](./pics/readme_pics/step6.png)

**step 7** : Mark the moments where distance is less than the receiver radius as ``1" in $N_{tmp}$, for better demonstrating, here use 10 as receiver radius.

![step7](./pics/readme_pics/step7.png)

**step 8** : Sum along the axis of the particle (axis=1) and superimpose on the final sequence of results.

![step8](./pics/readme_pics/step8.png)

**step 9** : Repeat **Step 3** to **Step 9**, until the whole sequence is end.

**step 10** : By sampling the final sequence Ntotal, get the received sequence N, e.g. N=[4,4,3,0,0].
